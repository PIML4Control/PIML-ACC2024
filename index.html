								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								In recent years, there has been an explosion of research on the intersection of machine learning
								and classical engineering domains. Machine learning is increasingly being used in the
								development of novel data-driven approaches for modeling and control of dynamical systems,
								traditionally dominated by physics-based models and scientific computing solvers.
								On the other hand, engineering and scientific computing principles are changing the
								machine learning landscape from purely black-box into domain-aware methods by incorporating
								more structure and prior knowledge into their model architectures and loss functions.
							</p>
							<p>
								 <b>Physics-informed machine learning </b> leverages the inherent knowledge and understanding of the
								physical world to inform the learning process of machine learning algorithms. By explicitly
								integrating physical laws, domain expertise, and prior knowledge into the learning framework,
								physics-informed learning empowers control systems to leverage the flexibility and adaptability of
								machine learning while remaining grounded in a solid understanding of the underlying dynamics.
								This fusion enables more efficient and trustworthy learning
								that results in control applications with superior performance, robustness, and interpretability.
							</p>
							<p>
								The potential applications of physics-informed machine learning for control and optimization
								are immense and diverse, spanning a wide range of domains. For example, in robotics,
								physics-informed learning can enhance the control of complex manipulators and autonomous
								agents by explicitly considering mechanical constraints, kinematics, and dynamics.
								Furthermore, in power systems and industrial processes, physics-informed learning can
								optimize control strategies by taking into
								account physical phenomena, such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics.
							</p>
							<p>
								This workshop aims to provide insight into recent advances in the field of physics-informed machine learning for modeling, control and optimization, and sketch some of the open challenges and opportunities using physics-informed machine learning. In the morning, experts with experience in physics-informed learning and optimization based control will present new results in this area and spotlight challenges and opportunities for the control community as well as recent advances in physics-informed learning in general. In the afternoon, a tutorial-style coding session will provide attendees hands-on experience with tools in the ecosystem of physics-informed learning.
The workshop targets an audience from graduate level to experienced theoretical and practically oriented control engineers who aim to improve their knowledge in physics-informed machine learning for control and optimization.
							</p>


							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p>
								The full-day workshop will be organized into a morning and an afternoon session,
								split by a lunch break. The morning session starts with a general introduction,
								followed by presentations on special topics and applications of physics-informed
								learning. In the afternoon, we will offer a tutorial-style hands-on coding session.

							<h3>Title: <a href="https://github.com/PIML4Control/PIML-ACC2024/tree/main/slides/Beckers_GPPHS.pdf">A Composable Physics-informed Learning Framework </a>
								   [08:45-09:30]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
								Reliable dynamical system models are key for operations like failure detection, design optimization, and safe control. However, first-principle models of complex systems such as water distribution networks, power grids, and other coupled dynamics suffer from time-consuming development and the need for expert knowledge. Dynamical models powered by machine learning face challenges like unknown trustworthiness, limited generalizability, and physical inconsistency, making them unsuitable for safe controller design. For that reason, we might want to decompose complex systems into subsystems to facilitate the modeling and verification process. However, that approach raises challenges like interconnecting ODE and PDE models while preserving physical correctness, quantifying and propagating uncertainty, and designing safe control algorithms.
In this talk, I will present our results on data-driven port-Hamiltonian systems (PHS) to enable trustworthy and accurate compositional modeling of complex dynamics including ODEs and PDEs while preserving physical consistency. We use ML techniques with uncertainty quantification to learn the Hamiltonian function of each subsystem. In contrast to many physics-informed techniques that impose physics by penalty, the proposed data-driven model is physically correct by design. The framework is in particular suitable for composable learning as its physical consistency can be preserved under interconnection. Finally, data-driven port-Hamiltonian systems can be used in a robust control setting to establish safe learning-based control.

                               <h3>Title: Learning & Control with Lagrangian-Gaussian Processes
								   [9:30-10:15]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
								The formulation of Gaussian Processes and other learning frameworks consistent with the relevant physical laws and mathematical models holds great promise for learning-based control of uncertain systems, improving data efficiency and reliability via their physical integrity. In particular, deep learning with neural networks has also shown auspicious results for physical systems. However, these methods lack a straightforward measure for uncertainty quantification, hampering the provision of guarantees, the applicability to robust & adaptive control, and leading to the inevitable requirement of low training errors only satisfied in the vicinity of the training domain. Thus, with the increasing uncertainty in physical systems, developing reliable yet tractable models is still a crucial ongoing issue.
This talk will address these issues by focusing on a common methodology behind different learning methods applied to control uncertain systems: integrating physical knowledge and other structural priors into the learning framework on the one hand and enforcing structure via control with learning on the other hand. In particular, we introduce the concept of physically consistent Lagrangian-Gaussian Processes (L-GPs) for data-driven modeling of uncertain Lagrangian systems, which constrain the function space according to the energy components of the Lagrangian and the differential equation structure, analytically guaranteeing properties such as energy conservation and quadratic form. Recent theoretical and experimental results on L-GP-based control & observation are presented in the form of exponential stability guarantees as well as in numerical and physical experiments.

                               <h3>Title: Learning Dissipative Neural Dynamical Models
								   [10:45-11:30]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
							Deep learning-based dynamical system models, such as neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) and physics-informed neural networks to capture the dynamical behavior of nonlinear systems have also recently gained attention. Particularly, such models can capture nonlinear dynamical behavior well beyond the ‘local’ region in the vicinity of the equilibrium that is captured by linear models, allowing us to expand the validity and usefulness of our control designs. However, when identifying models for control, it is typically not sufficient to simply obtain a model that approximates the dynamical behavior of the system. Rather, we would ideally like to preserve essential system properties such as stability in the identified models. One such control-relevant system property that is particularly useful is dissipativity, which provides a general framework to guarantee several crucial properties like L2 stability, passivity, conicity, and sector-boundedness, and can facilitate elegant distributed and compositional control designs in large-scale systems. Therefore, it is particularly attractive to learn neural dynamical models that capture relevant system dynamics, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this talk, we present a two-stage framework towards learning a dissipative neural dynamical system models. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.
